## This is distShiny. Or ShinyDist. Whatever

It's a simple visualization tool to get a feeling for three of the most important distributions in statistics.

Basically it's just me playing around with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com).
The R-Code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jemus42/distShiny).
