## This is `distShiny` version `1.2.1`

It's a simple visualization tool to get a feeling for three of the most important distributions in statistics.  
Basically it's just me playing around with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com).

See the live version at [shinyapps.io](https://jemus42.shinyapps.io/distShiny/)
